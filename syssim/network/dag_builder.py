"""DAG construction from communication steps with automatic dependency inference.

This module converts high-level communication patterns (list of steps) into a
dependency DAG (list of Ops) suitable for simulation.

Key concepts:
- Step: A list of concurrent sends in a single algorithmic phase
        Format: list[tuple[src, dst, size_bytes]]
- Op: A single point-to-point send with explicit dependencies
- build_dag(): Infers dependencies from 2 physical rules

Dependency rules:
1. Data dependency: Send FROM rank r at step s depends on sends TO rank r at step s-1
                   (rank can't send data it hasn't received)
2. Send serialization: Send FROM rank r depends on previous send FROM rank r
                      (NIC can only send one message at a time)

Design choice: We do NOT add receive-side serialization dependencies because
the congestion engine already handles inbound bandwidth contention. Adding
explicit receive dependencies would be redundant and overly conservative.

    """Build dependency DAG from communication steps using 2 physical rules.

    This function converts a high-level algorithmic description (list of steps)
    into a concrete DAG suitable for simulation. Dependencies are inferred
    automatically from physical constraints.

    Rules:
    1. Data dependency (receive-before-send):
       - Send FROM rank r at step s depends on sends TO rank r at step s-1
       - Example: In reduce-scatter, rank 0 can't send chunk_i at step 1
         until it receives chunk_i from rank 1 at step 0

    2. Send serialization (single-threaded NIC):
       - Send FROM rank r at step s depends on send FROM rank r at step s-1
       - Example: Rank 0 can't start sending message 2 until message 1 is
         in flight (NIC serialization)

    Why these 2 rules are sufficient:
    - Rule 1 enforces causality (can't send data you don't have)
    - Rule 2 enforces sender exclusivity (one send at a time per rank)
    - Receive-side contention handled by simulator (bandwidth sharing)
    - No need for explicit receive-side serialization dependencies

    Args:
        steps: List of communication steps, each step is list[(src, dst, size)]
        tag_prefix: Optional prefix for op tags (e.g., "allreduce", "broadcast")

    Returns:
        List of Op objects with dependencies populated

    Example:
        >>> # 2-rank reduce-scatter (simplified)
        >>> steps = [
        ...     [(0, 1, 100), (1, 0, 100)],  # Step 0: exchange chunks
        ... ]
        >>> ops = build_dag(steps, tag_prefix="reduce_scatter")
        >>> len(ops)
        2
        >>> ops[0].tag
        'reduce_scatter_step_0'
        >>> # No dependencies in first step
        >>> ops[0].deps
        []

    Example with dependencies:
        >>> # 3-rank ring allreduce (reduce-scatter phase)
        >>> steps = [
        ...     [(0, 1, 100), (1, 2, 100), (2, 0, 100)],  # Step 0

        ... ]

        >>> # Step 1 ops depend on:
        >>> # - Receives TO same rank at step 0 (Rule 1)
        >>> # - Send FROM same rank at step 0 (Rule 2)
        >>> ops[3].deps  # First op in step 1
